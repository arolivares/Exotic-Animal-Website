     <h2>About Common Ravens</h2>
     <p>
        The <Strong>common raven</Strong> or it's scientific name, <em>Corvus Corax</em> is apart of roughly 10 species of heavy-billed dark birds that are larger than crows. The reason crows amd ravens look so similar is due the the fact that they are closely related. Though they have differences, ravens typically have heavier bills and shaggier plumage around the throat compared to that of a crow. A raven's feathers aren't completely black, they actually have a blue or purplish iridescence to them. The Common Raven has been in the Northern Hemisphere for centuries and has accompanied people for centuries. These birds thrive among humans and in other places as well. Ravens can be found in the outskirts of towns, to forests and deep in the mountains and national parks. To know if a raven is near you, you're going to hear a deep gurgling croak from above you, and you'll see a long-tailed black bird flying with its long wings. The Common Raven is very intelligent making them very dangerous predators in the wild. They can work in pairs to raid bird colonies, and even seen waiting in trees as sheep give birth to then attack the newborns.
